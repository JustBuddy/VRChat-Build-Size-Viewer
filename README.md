# VRChat Build Size Viewer
 Fork adds an additional total sizes of referenced package data, to measure a packages footprint in a build.  
   
 A script for viewing the build size for VRC worlds and avatars after building.
 It's kinda ugly. So sorry about that. Made it for myself, but thought it might be handy for others!

## How To Use
- Just place the file [BuildSizeViewer.cs](https://github.com/MunifiSense/VRChat-Build-Size-Viewer/releases/download/1.2/BuildSizeViewer.cs) into your Unity project in Assets/Editor.  
- Go to Window/Muni/VRC Build Size Viewer.  
- Then build a world or an avatar in Unity, either for testing or upload.  
- Click Read Build Log.  
- TADA.
